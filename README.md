# LoL - List of Lists

LoL is a idea of app that came to my mind when I was looking for a universal list app, and when I tried a few of the best ones on the play market, **I said LoL.**

## Why?
Because these apps offer me strange features, such as:
- music in the app
- Create a list with only a certain category, for example:
  - Movies
  - TV shows
  - Games
  - Board games
  - Links
  - To do
 and these are all available categories of lists, so I was surprised and told **LoL**.
 
I complained a little about these apps afterwards, but then I remembered the words: "Criticizing? Suggest it!" **(is a crude translation of the Russian expression: "Критикуешь? Предлагай!")**

So, first of all, I wrote a list of what I want to get out of the List application:
- Any list can be either numbered or not; **(it's funny, huh?)**
- Any list can be a sub-list of other;
- Any list should be able to collapse/uncollapse;
- Any item in a list can be a link
  - It's a great idea to support link naming.
- The user should by able sort any list; **(it's funny, huh?)**
  - It would be great if it was possible to add a new field for a list item, and be able to sort by it without having to maintain this in the code;
